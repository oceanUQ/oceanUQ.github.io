  This <a href="https://usclivar.org/">US CLIVAR</a> Working Group (WG) will form a focused forum to discuss how Uncertainty Quantification and associated concepts can be incorporated into oceanographic research in general, including but not limited to: training of current and future scientists, observing system design, process study conceptualization, data acquisition and processing, modeling and data assimilation. Notably, a point of focus will be to assess how both observationalists and modelers should describe uncertainty in their products in order to facilitate the exchange and use of data between their two communities.

  There already exists a momentum among oceanographic communities for activities supporting improved quantification and communication of uncertainties. This WG will capitalize on the outcomes and action items from previous activities on UQ, and serve as a means to provide continuing coordination, progress, and concrete outcomes for this topic. Furthermore, the working group activities contribute to the broad mission of the <a href="https://usclivar.org/about-us-clivar">US CLIVAR science goals</a>.

  <h1>The objectives of the WG are:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a community-driven web platform for UQ knowledge and strategies.</li>
        <li>Produce peer-reviewed open-access articles on UQ for observational and model ocean data.</li>
        <li>Organize a summer school and/or workshop on UQ.</li>
      </ul>
