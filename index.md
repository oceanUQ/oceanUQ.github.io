OceanUQ is a platform to develop strategies and identify best practices for improving the understanding, derivation, communication, and utilization of the uncertainties of ocean in-situ, remote, and modeled data.

Under the umbrella of [US CLIVAR](https://usclivar.org), a working group has come together to discuss how Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and its associated concepts can be systematically incorporated into oceanographic research, including but not limited to: training of current and future scientists, observing systems and process studies designs, data workflow, modeling, and data assimilation. A notable point of focus is to assess how both observationalists and modelers describe uncertainty in their products, and how they can adopt consistent strategies and terminoligy in order to facilitate the exchange and use of data between their respective communities.
