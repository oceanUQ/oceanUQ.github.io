  <h1>Mission Statement</h1>

We are broadly interested in developing strategies, and identify best practices, for improving the understanding, derivation, communication, and utilization of the uncertainties of ocean in-situ, remote, and modeled products related to physical variables.

We will form a focused forum to discuss how Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and its associated concepts can be incorporated into scientific research in general, including but not limited to: training of current and future scientists, observing system design, process study conceptualization, data acquisition and processing, modeling and data assimilation. Notably, a point of focus will be to assess how both observationalists and modelers should describe uncertainty in their products in order to facilitate the exchange of data between their two communities. 

  <h1>Our objectives are:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Objective 1: Develop a community-driven web platform for UQ knowledge and strategies.</li>
        <li>Objective 2: Produce peer-reviewed open-access articles on UQ for observational and model ocean data.</li>
        <li>Objective 3: Organize a summer school and/or workshop on UQ.</li>
      </ul>
